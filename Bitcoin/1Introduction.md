# Introduction

## What is Bitcoin ?
### Definition
- Bitcoin is a **collection of concepts and technologies** that form the basis of a digital money ecosystem
- Bitcoin users communicate with each other using the **bitcoin protocol** primarily via the internet, although other transport networks can also be used.
- Users can transfer bitcoin over the network to do just about anything that can be done with conventional currencies.
- Bitcoin in a sense is the perfect form of money for the internet because it is **fast, secure, and borderless**.
- Bitcoin is **entirely virtual**. Users of bitcoin own **keys** that allow them to prove ownership of bitcoin in the bitcoin network. Keys are often stored in a **digital wallet** on each userâ€™s computer or smartphone.
- The bitcoin protocol includes built-in algorithms that regulate the mining function across the network. The protocol also halves the rate at which new bitcoin is created every 4 years, and limits the total number of bitcoin that will be created to a fixed total just below 21 million coins. The number of bitcoin in circulation closely follows an easily predictable curve that approaches 21 million by the year 2140
- Bitcoin consists of:
  - A decentralized peer-to-peer network (**the bitcoin protocol**)
  - A public transaction ledger (**the blockchain**)
  - A set of rules for independent transaction and currency issuance (**consensus rules**)
  - A mechanism for reaching global decentralized consensus (**Proof of Work algorithm**)
### Decentralized System
- Bitcoin is a **distributed, peer-to-peer system**
- Bitcoin are created through a process called "**mining**", which involves competing to find solutions to a mathematical problem while processing bitcoin transactions.

### Cryptography
- The emergence of viable digital money is closely linked to developments in cryptography
- Cryptographic digital signatures, which enable a user to sign a digital asset or transaction proving the ownership of that asset, can address the double-spend issue.

## Getting started 
### Choosing a bitcoin wallet
- Bitcoin wallets vary in quality, performance, security, privacy, and reliability
- Bitcoin wallets are one of the **most actively developed applications** in the bitcoin ecosystem.
- Many wallets focus on specific platforms or specific uses and some are more suitable for **beginners** while others are filled with features for **advanced** users -> choosing a wallet is **highly subjective**
- Bitcoin wallets can be categorized as follow, according to platforms.
  - _Desktop wallet_ 
    - Running on general-use operating system
    - Having certain security disadvantages due to insecure and poorly configured platforms
  - _Mobile wallet_
    - The most common type of bitcoin wallet
    - Running on smart-phone operating systems
    - A great choice for new users
    - Some are designed for simplicity and easy-to-use 
    - Some are fully featured
  - _Web wallet_
    - Operating a secure self-contained bitcoin wallet on special-purpose hardware
    - Connecting to desktop or mobile device and 
    - Being operated with a web browser or accompanying software 
    - Very secure and suitable for storing large amounts of bitcoins
  - _Paper wallet_
    - Offering a low-tech but highly secure means of storing bitcoin long term.
    - Often refered to as cold storage
- Another way to categorize bitcoin wallet is by their degree of autonomy and how they interact with the bitcoin network
  - _Full-node client_         
    - Handling all aspects of protocol, independently validate the entire blockchain and any transaction
    - Comsuming substantial computer resources
  - _Lightweight client_ 
    - Connecting to bitcoin full nodes for access to the bitcoin transaction information 
    - Storing the user wallet locally and independently creates, validates, and transmits transactions
    - Interacting directly with the bitcoin network, without intermediary
  - _Third-party API client_
    - Interacting with bitcoin through a third-party system of API
    - All transactions go through a third party.
- Three most common are desktop full client, mobile lightweight wallet and web-third party wallet. 
### Mnemonic phrase
- A mordern bitcoin wallet will provide **mnemonic phrase** which can be used to restore all the transactions and funds in her wallet.
- The mnemonic phrase should be **carefully stored** in a way that balances the need to prevent theft and accidental loss.
