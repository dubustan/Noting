# **Report (29/8): Comparison between two papers related to Anonymized Data**
## **Introduction**
This report aims to make a comparison between the problem of two papers before providing papers related to collaborative data anonymization.
- The first one is _K. Wong, N. A. Tu, D. Bui, S. Y. Ooi, and M. H. Kim, "PrivacyPreserving Collaborative Data Anonymization with Sensitive QuasiIdentifiers," in 2019 12th CMI Conference on Cybersecurity and
Privacy (CMI), 28-29 Nov. 2019 2019, pp. 1-6, doi: 10.1109/CMI48017.2019.8962140._
- The second one is _T. Nandy, M. Y. I. B. Idris, R. M. Noor, S. Bhattacharyya and N. B. A. Ghani, "Collaborative Data Anonymization for Privacy-Preserving Vehicular Ad-hoc Network," 2020 International Conference on Innovation and Intelligence for Informatics, Computing and Technologies (3ICT), 2020, pp. 1-6, doi: 10.1109/3ICT51146.2020.9312024_
## **Similarities and differences**
### **Similarities**
- **Quasi-identifier** could be used with external knowledge to identify individuals.
- **Locally data anonymization**  does not result in desired privacy protection level or is not suitable for a collaborative network such as VANET.
### **Differences**

|Purpose|The collected data is used for a local analysis to support a **query-answer system**. - No data should be leaked to external parties|The data anonymization helps vehicles to share information safely in an **insecure vehicular ad-hoc network** - **Privacy-related issues** and **network attacks**|
|Problem|<ul><li>Increase the **confidence** of **respondents** during data collection - Respondents are not willing to reveal their data due to privacy concern.</li><li> Protect both **sensitive-QID** and **sensitive attributes** while maintaining the **utility** of the released microdata</li></ul>|<ul><li>Achieve a desirable level of **data sanitization** in a group</li><li>Help vehicles to share information safely in an **insecure network**</li></ul>|
